# Backup script for Raspberry Pi
This script does an image backup of the Pi SD card using dd. It is not the most efficient method, but it creates a complete backup and it's easy to restore in case of complete card failure.

## Installation
- Clone this repo into the folder where you keep your housekeeping scripts.
- Modify the MOUNTPOINT and SUBDIR variables to point to your destination
- Modify STARTSTOPSERVICE variables to 1 if you want your serives stopped/started
- Update services stop and start sections to reflect your installated services
- Optional: Modify GZIP variable if you want your backups zipped
- Make executable. ```chmod +x backup.sh```
- Update crontab to run each it each night.

___Example___

Update /etc/crontab to run backup.sh as root every night at 3am

```01 3    * * *   root    /home/pi/scripts/backup.sh```

The backup took a little more than an hour on my first run (SD card to USB HDD).
